project-library
this is a long term project of mine,
it's basically gonna be an anime library for users that they can track all the animes they watched,
for now it's a manual more like notepad-ish,
but my future plans are to make it into a full scale application for easy-tracking recommending accordingly...etc i'm not gonna give you all my ideas this easily.

anyway short term goals are:
genre grouping easier input methods and backending the entire thing when  we get there in my learning process.
working on the css design is definently a must but for development rn this is good enough until i figure out where this journey is gonna take us.

stay tuned!!
